# GMSET9
An MSET9 injector that runs from a second, hacked, 3DS running GodMode9

Development is currently paused until I get a flashcart.
## Credits
- zoogie, for discovering the [MSET9](https://github.com/zoogie/MSET9) exploit.
- d0k3 and the other [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9) contributors. Without GM9 this would be substantially harder to make. (I certainly wouldn't be able to, at least)
- Others, probably. This isn't finished yet, so who knows who else might be a big help in getting this to work (or it could all crash and burn and I'm making this preemptively, who knows.)
## Plans
- Actually finish the script
- Get a better way of detecting corruption than matching sha256's to specific version of said software (Promotes using an AIO and is just annoying and poorly written)
- ...pretty much it
